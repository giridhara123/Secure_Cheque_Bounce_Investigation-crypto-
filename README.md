📝 Overview

This system addresses security challenges in traditional cheque processing by implementing a multi-layered verification process. It leverages visual cryptography to split cheque images into two complementary shares, ensures tamper detection using SHA-256 hashing, and secures banker access via Duo two-factor authentication.

⸻

🚀 Features
	•	XOR-based Visual Cryptography: Splits cheque images into two shares.
	•	SHA-256 Integrity Checking: Detects tampering through cryptographic hashing.
	•	Duo Two-Factor Authentication: Secures banker login via push notifications.
	•	Role-based Access Control: Distinct interfaces for customers and bankers.
	•	Secure Email Transmission: Sends Share 1 securely via email.
	•	Encrypted Database Storage: Stores Share 2 and metadata securely.
	•	User-friendly Web Interface: Built using Streamlit for easy navigation.

⸻

🏛️ System Architecture
	1.	Customer Interface
	•	Upload cheque images and provide verification details.
	2.	Visual Cryptography Engine
	•	Generate XOR-based shares and compute SHA-256 hash.
	3.	Authentication Module
	•	Duo push-based multi-factor authentication for bankers.
	4.	Verification Interface
	•	Reconstruct cheque and validate integrity.

🔄 Workflows

🧑‍💼 Customer Workflow
	1.	Upload signed cheque image.
	2.	Enter cheque number and usage message.
	3.	Provide banker’s email.
	4.	Submit for share generation.
	5.	System emails Share 1 to banker and stores Share 2 securely.

🏦 Banker Workflow
	1.	Login with username/password.
	2.	Approve Duo push notification on mobile device.
	3.	Enter cheque number to verify.
	4.	Upload Share 1 (received via email).
	5.	System retrieves Share 2, reconstructs cheque, and verifies integrity.
	6.	View verification result.

⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Configure Environment Variables (.env)

DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_NAME=your_db_name
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
EMAIL_USER=your_email@example.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
DUO_IKEY=your_duo_integration_key
DUO_SKEY=your_duo_secret_key
DUO_HOST=your_duo_api_hostname
APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8501

3. Create MySQL Database Schema

CREATE TABLE cheques (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    cheque_number VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    share1 LONGBLOB,
    share2 LONGBLOB,
    original_hash VARCHAR(64),
    issue_message TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE bankers (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    banker_password VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

4. Run the Application

streamlit run app.py



⸻

🛡️ Security Considerations
	•	Credentials secured via environment variables.
	•	Temporary files removed after processing.
	•	Input validation against SQL Injection.
	•	Secure email transmission for Share 1.
	•	Two-factor authentication to prevent unauthorized access.

🧩 Implementation Details

1. Visual Cryptography (XOR-Based)
	•	Share Generation:
	•	S1: Random matrix of same dimensions as cheque image C.
	•	S2 = C ⊕ S1
	•	Reconstruction:
	•	C = S1 ⊕ S2

2. SHA-256 Integrity Verification
	1.	Compute SHA-256 hash of the original cheque image.
	2.	Store hash in the database with Share 2.
	3.	On verification, reconstruct cheque using S1 and S2.
	4.	Compute and compare SHA-256 hash with stored hash to detect tampering.

3. Two-Factor Authentication
	•	Step 1: Username/Password verification.
	•	Step 2: Duo Push Notification to banker’s registered device.
